# Prometheus MSLA Panel & Plate Drawings
Here you can find all of the .dxf files for the enclosure panels and base/mid
plates for the Prometheus MSLA Printer.

## Enclosure Panels
All of the enclosure panels can be cut from 4mm (5/32") acrylic or ABS sheet.
The door panel should be transparent, if you wish to see inside the machine, but
beyond that basically any material may be used. Keep in mind, thicker or thinner
panels may require differently sized screws.

## Middle Plate and Base Plate
The "Middle Plate" and the "Base Plate" need to be about 12.5mm (1/2") thick.

You can use something like HDPE for easier cleaning, or even just MDF (which you
will need to seal) for a cheaper build.
