# Prometheus MSLA Printed Parts STLs
Here you can find the .stl files for all of the 3D-printed parts for the
Prometheus MSLA Printer.

## Material
We recommend printing the vat in PLA or PETG! Other materials may react with the
chemicals in the resin.

The Structural parts (such as the arm) need to be very 
rigid--they can be printed in PLA, carbon fiber filled material, or other stiff
plastics.

## Print Settings
All the parts should be printed at 0.2mm layer height, with at least 35% infill
and at least 6 walls (with a .4 nozzle).


## Updates
For the latest versions of each part, see the full assembly [here](../CAD/).
