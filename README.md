In greek mythology there is a legend of a Titan named Prometheus, he is known
for defying the gods by stealing fire and gifting it back to humanity.

Not only did he give them fire, Prometheus also taught humans how to use fire,
thus giving them the skill of metalwork, then ensued science and the arts,
allowing us to create everything we have today.

We created this project because we wanted to offer a machine that was accessible
to everyone, we wanted it to be easily modified so that you can create and give
your machine your own personal touch.
